# joezone
*Just what I need, and nothing more.*

## About

A JavaScript Library for node.js-based projects with no npm-module dependencies. 

## Here's what I need:

1. Contract by Design
2. POSIX file assemble and disassembly
3. POSIX file system searching
4. Line delimited file I/O
5. String concatenation and truncation
6. A good logging system in order to trace, profile, monitor, and interrupt the execution of code.

## Testing
The joezone library has been tested using the [Bequiesce](http://bequiesce.com) test harness.
